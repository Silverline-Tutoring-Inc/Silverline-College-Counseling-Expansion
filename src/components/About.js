              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s'>Silverline Tutoring is an educational 501(c)(3) nonprofit
                connecting tutors and students within our organization of over 5000 dedicated members. Founded by
                college and high school students, this company recognizes the difficulty of learning—we’ve all
                been there.</p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-3s'>From the depths of math to complex texts in English,
                every student has struggled at one point or another. We want to bridge this divide in education
                by providing free tutoring to any student. But how do we accomplish this difficult task?</p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-4s'>Silverline creates a free and flexible tutoring service
                by finding the experts in our community and assigning them to students in need. For instance, if
                someone has 2+ years of experience in chemistry, they would apply to become a tutor and earn
                community service hours in exchange for their work. This framework allows us to serve as many
                students as possible at the cost of nothing while still maintaining quality. </p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s'>At Silverline, we want to solve the education divide, one
                student at a time, by making learning enjoyable and stress-free for all. Therefore, we never
                hold students accountable to a strict schedule and always work based on the student needs,
                allowing them to benefit the most. Our tutors are vetted in advance to ensure that they are
                student-friendly and adaptable. Monthly trivia contests and other games are also held to promote
                a fun learning environment. We want to set our students up for success while building a strong
                community that facilitates opportunities for everyone involved. Because of this foundation, our
                community now serves up to 5000 members.</p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s'>Silverline is primarily for students in high school.
                However, our reach extends beyond simply highschoolers. We also offer services to elementary and
                middle schoolers and college-level students, depending on the course. Our diverse group of
                tutors allows us to serve a greater population of people. </p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-3s'>Additionally, aside from students, adults and any other
                age group are also welcome if they are looking for a refresher in a past course or simply
                looking to learn something new.</p>

              <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-4s'>In terms of tutors, Silverline accepts anyone from
                sophomore year of highschool and above. In the past, we have had school teachers helping in our
                system, meaning that even adults are more than welcome to join our community. Therefore,
                regardless of age or education, Silverline is an open outlet for all groups whether it be in the
                form of being a student or a teacher.</p>
