						Getting involved with Silverline Educational Advisory Services has never been
						easier. Below are two forms for applicants based on
						interested in being tutored or becoming a tutor. The
						process for either is relatively simple.

						Once a tutor has signed up, our human resources officer
						will reach out requesting either an interview or a
						resume. In the case of an interview, our human resources
						officer will ask a few basic questions and follow up by
						asking for the tutor to present a 15 - 20 minute lesson
						on a subject they desire to teach in. The other option
						is to provide a resume, which will be reviewed by our
						executive team. Acceptance or deferral as a tutor will
						be provided shortly thereafter.
					</p>

					>
						If a student desires to receive tutoring, they should
						fill out the second form on this page. Our human
						resources officer will be in contact with them after
						receiving their request. The student will be brought
						into the Discord community server and be paired with an
						appropriate tutor. This tutor serves as someone who can
						serve longer lessons or answer quick questions in the
						target subject.
